    "section": "Part 2: Contact manager",
    "text": "Part 2: Contact manager\nContact manager is a database that stores the contact information of our participants. It is used to track the recruitment process, screen participant’s eligibility and follow-up with the participants.\nFor example, if we received a reply card from a potential patient who indicated interest in participating our study, we need to 1) screen the participant to see if he/she/they are eligible for our study; 2) if eligible, add this potential participant to the contact manager database. In this case, we need to work on the Case_recruitment_contact_manager.accdb file.\nHere is the dashboard view for it: \n\nStep 1: Eligibility screening\n\nClick on Screening patients button to open the screening form. And you will see something like this: \n\nOn the left side, you will see the information from PD registry if the participant is from the registry. Otherwise, it will be blank. On the right side, you will need to input the information you collected from recruitment process (e.g., reply card, phone call, etc.). Sometimes, the information from the registry is not accurate or outdated, so you need to verify the information with the participant.\n\nSwitch to the “Screening” tab and input the information you collected in the screening process.  Based on the information, please determine if the participant is eligible for our study and input the corresponding screening status in the “Screening status 1” field.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Assign PEGID\nIf the participant is eligible, you need to assign a PEGID to the participant. The PEGID is a unique identifier for each participant in our study. For every reply card that we mailed to the participant, a MailID is pre-assigned. A PEGID is the combination of MailID + Participant's Initials + last two digits of birth year. You can assign the PEGID by clicking the Add New Patients button, search for the corresponding MailID and put the new PEGID in the field in front of that MailID.\n\n\nStep 3: Add to contact manager\nThe Add to Contact manager button is greyed out by default. If you would like to add this participant in our database if eligible and willing to participate, please make sure to check Are you willing to consider participating in the PEG Study. Once the participant is added to the contact manager, the PEG3 Contact Manager form will pop out and the basic information will be automatically filled in the contact manager form. You can also go back to the dashboard and click the “See Patient Details” button to open the contact manager form. You will see something like this:  and you can input the information you collected from the participant in the corresponding fields.",

    "text": "Part 3: Entry databases\nThe entry databases are used to store the data that we collected from the participants during the interview. The data are organized in a structured way so that we can easily access and analyze them. In PEG study, we have entry 1 and entry 2 for Cases, Household controls and Population controls, respectively. Each database contains the forms for different sections of the interview. The reason why we are doing two different entries is to ensure the data quality and reduce the error rate since people make mistakes!\nFor example, we are going to enter data for a PD patient who has completed the interview. In this case, we need to work on the PEG 3 Entry Database_Case.accdb file.\n\nStep 1: Data entry\n\nThe main switch board looks like this:  then put your cursor in the PEGID field, press ctrl + F to search for the participant ID that you are going to enter data for. Then, navigate to the corresponding form by clicking the button on the switch board. The format and layout of each form in the database should be consistent with the paper/eletronic version that we use in the interview. If you notice any discrepancy, please report to the data manager.\nMake sure to put your initials and date of entry in the corresponding fields in the form so that we can track the data entry process.\nIf you cannot find the participant ID in the database, please close it and open it again to make sure that you are using the most updated version of the database. If you still cannot find the participant ID, please report to the data manager.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Save and exit\nAfter you finish entering data for a participant, press ctrl + S to save the data or right click the form and select “Save record”. Note that sometimes you might encounter a pop-up window saying that you cannot save the record at this time. This is because someone else is editing the same database. In this case, please wait for a few minutes or negotiate with the other person to see if he/she can close the database for a while so that you can save the record.",

It is essential to protect sensitive information such as name, address, phone number, etc. for our participants. Therefore, we must follow best practices to ensure data security.\n\nStudy data of Ritz Lab\nIn PEG study, there are different types of computers and storage, most cannot be accessed via the Internet.\n\nRitz Server : (Network attached storage) NAS server connecting most researcher computers via Ethernet (connected to the Internet).\nPEG-Boss : PEG study NAS server connecting computers inside the PEG Office (transfer data through switch, not connected to the Internet)\nSecure computer: A data enclave that contains personal identifiable data from the state government. (Disconnected from network)\nEncrypted hard-drives and flash-drives: containing de-identified data for sharing with researchers/collaborators\nUCLAHealth BOX (HIPPA compliant limited access – need Mednet email)\n\n\nPortable devices\nPortable devices such as laptops, hard-drives are commonly used to access and store sensitive data. It is essential to secure these devices to prevent unauthorized access to data. Here are some best practices for securing portable devices:\n\nUse strong passwords to protect these devices (PGP/Bitlocker/filevault)\nDo not save any data or dataset on unencrypted local personal devices\nRegularly backup external hard drives to the Ritz network at UCLA\nReturn the external hard drive to the project data manager upon completion of the approved analyses (or expiration of Confidentiality agreement)\nDo not include HIPAA identifiers in any dataset placed on an external drives, unless allowed by the IRB and permitted in writing by the PIs\nDo not leave portable devices unattended in public places\n\n\n\nUCLA Health BOX\nUCLA Health BOX is a HIPAA-compliant cloud storage service that allows users to securely store and share files, while UCLA BOX is the personal Box folder linked to student’s UCLA email address for storage of personal data (not HIPAA compliant). It is essential to use UCLA Health BOX to store and share sensitive information to ensure data security. Here are some best practices for using UCLA Health BOX:\n\nOnly share files with authorized users\nDo not store study data on your personal Box folders (UCLA or non-UCLA) or other cloud-based storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox)\nWhile storing data containing HIPAA identifier is allowed on UCLAHealth Box, we strongly recommend to reduce the amount of personal identifier information to minimum.\n\n\n\n\nHIPAA personal identifiers\nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule regulation specifies 18 identifiers, listed below, most of which are demographic. Inclusion of even one of the following identifiers makes a data set identifiable.\n\nName\n*All geographic subdivisions smaller than state, including street address, city county, and zip code, and their equivalent geocodes\nAll elements (except years) of dates related to an individual (including birthdate, admission date, discharge date, date of death, and exact age if over 89)\nTelephone numbers\nFax number\nEmail address\nSocial Security Number\nMedical record number\nHealth plan beneficiary number\nAccount number\nCertificate or license number\nVehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers\nDevice identifiers and serial numbers\nWeb URL\nInternet Protocol (IP) Address\nBiometric identifiers, including finger or voice print\nPhotographic image - Full-face photographs and any comparable images.\nAny other characteristic that could uniquely identify the individual\nExceptions of this identifier could be found at https://ohrpp.research.ucla.edu/hipaa/",

Please note the instructions for CITI training may be a little different while you are registering as the website keeps updating, please use your best judgment to fill out the question prompts. If you have already completed the CITI training and HIPAA training, please send Yufan Gong (ivangong@ucla.edu) your certificates. Once you complete the training, he will also send you the invitation to the BOX folder of PEG study.
